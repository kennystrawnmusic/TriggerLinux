# Configuration for the one-user-system user module.
#
# Besides these settings, the user module also places the following
# keys into the globalconfig area, based on user input in the view step.
#
# - hostname
# - username
# - password (obscured)
# - autologinUser (if enabled, set to username)
#
# These globalconfig keys are set when the jobs for this module
# are created.
---
# Used as default groups for the created user.
# Adjust to your Distribution defaults.
defaultGroups:
    - users
    - lp
    - video
    - network
    - storage
    - wheel
    - audio

# Some Distributions require a 'autologin' group for the user.
# Autologin causes a user to become automatically logged in to
# the desktop environment on boot.
# Disable when your Distribution does not require such a group.
autologinGroup:  autologin
# You can control the initial state for the 'autologin checkbox' in UsersViewStep here.
# Possible values are: true to enable or false to disable the checkbox by default
doAutologin:     true

# When set to a non-empty string, Calamares creates a sudoers file for the user.
#  /etc/sudoers.d/10-installer
# Remember to add sudoersGroup to defaultGroups.
#
# If your Distribution already sets up a group of sudoers in its packaging,
# remove this setting (delete or comment out the line below). Otherwise,
# the setting will be duplicated in the /etc/sudoers.d/10-installer file,
# potentially confusing users.
sudoersGroup:    wheel

# Setting this to false , causes the root account to be disabled.
setRootPassword: true
# You can control the initial state for the 'root password checkbox' in UsersViewStep here.
# Possible values are: true to enable or false to disable the checkbox by default.
# When enabled the user password is used for the root account too.
# NOTE: doReusePassword requires setRootPassword to be enabled.
doReusePassword: true

# These are optional password-requirements that a distro can enforce
# on the user. The values given in this sample file disable each check,
# as if the check was not listed at all.
#
# Checks may be listed multiple times; each is checked separately,
# and no effort is done to ensure that the checks are consistent
# (e.g. specifying a maximum length less than the minimum length
# will annoy users).
#
# The libpwquality check relies on the (optional) libpwquality library.
# Its value is a list of configuration statements that could also
# be found in pwquality.conf, and these are handed off to the
# libpwquality parser for evaluation. The check is ignored if
# libpwquality is not available at build time (generates a warning in
# the log). The Calamares password check rejects passwords with a
# score of < 40 with the given libpwquality settings.
#
# (additional checks may be implemented in CheckPWQuality.cpp and
# wired into UsersPage.cpp)
passwordRequirements:
    minLength: -1  # Password at least this many characters
    maxLength: -1  # Password at most this many characters
    libpwquality:
        - minlen=0
        - minclass=0

# Shell to be used for the regular user of the target system.
# There are three possible kinds of settings:
#  - unset (i.e. commented out, the default), act as if set to /bin/bash
#  - empty (explicit), don't pass shell information to useradd at all
#    and rely on a correct configuration file in /etc/default/useradd
#  - set, non-empty, use that path as shell. No validation is done
#    that the shell actually exists or is executable.
# userShell: /bin/bash
