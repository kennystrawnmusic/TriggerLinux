# TriggerLinux 19.06 Release Notes
Although it is rolling release (as is upstream Gentoo, whose repositories it does still use), TriggerLinux still, also like Gentoo, releases snapshot ISO images for installation. [Download Here](https://mega.nz/#!JEdE2IaT!_f9B-2GCRmJnjTgJFyc7ZZ79zdn2V0blXwqiGjGZ3HQ)

## Feature Changes and Bug Fixes

* Linux Kernel 5.1
* [Jade Application Kit (JAK)](https://github.com/codesardine/Jade-Application-Kit) support
* Gab, Minds, and Parler now all bundled as JAK hybrid apps
* Replaced LibreOffice with [ms-office-online](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ms-office-online) JAK hybrid apps in order to reduce ISO image size
* Replaced Firefox with Brave as bundled browser
* Upgraded bundled Claymore miner to version 14.7
* Bundled an XAMPP server installer for easy one-click installation of server software (should come in handy for sites like Gab in particular that keep getting banned by hosting providers for political reasons)
* F2FS support (using bleeding-edge version of GRUB)

## Known Issues

* Ethernet sometimes connects and disconnects repeatedly in an infinite loop
  * **Workaround**:
    1. Disable NetworkManager notifications by clicking on the icon that looks like a bunch of switches on one of the notifications themselves, then uncheck "Device Failed" > "Show a message in a popup", uncheck "Connection Activated" > "Show a message in a popup", and finally uncheck "Connection Deactivated" > "Show a message in a popup"
    1. Disconnect from "Wired Connection 1". "eno1" should then connect automatically.
* Server installer pops up "You must be root" error message
  * **Workaround**:
    1. Press Ctrl-Alt-T to open a terminal window
    1. Type "sudo su" (without the quotes) and press Enter (type your password when prompted)
    1. Type "echo "$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL)" >> /etc/sudoers" (without the outer quotes but **with** the inner quotes) and press Enter
    1. Close the terminal window
    1. Press Alt-F2, type "sudo Desktop/server-install.run", and press Enter
* Gab, Parler, and Minds JAK web apps won't work on live media
  * **Workaround**: Press Alt-F2, type either "gab --no-sandbox", "parler --no-sandbox", or "minds --no-sandbox", and press Enter
