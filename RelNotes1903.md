# Triggerbox 19.03 Release Notes
Although it is rolling release (as is upstream Arch Linux, whose repositories it does still use), Triggerbox still, also like Arch Linux, releases snapshots every month, starting with this first stable release. [Download Here](https://mega.nz/#!5I90hSqS!sdqOLBzg1SBGOkRt8rqnB88bCvO9rZvpHgBT9OVMiy0)
