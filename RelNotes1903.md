# TriggerLinux 19.03 Release Notes
Although it is rolling release (as is upstream Gentoo, whose repositories it does still use), TriggerLinux still, also like Gentoo, releases snapshots every month, starting with this first stable release. [Download Here](https://mega.nz/#!5I90hSqS!sdqOLBzg1SBGOkRt8rqnB88bCvO9rZvpHgBT9OVMiy0)
